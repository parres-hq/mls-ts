# MLS Implementation Roadmap

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY STATUS: NOT PRODUCTION READY

**Current implementation is for research/educational purposes only** See
[SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md](./SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md) for details.

## Phase 1: Core Protocol Implementation (Current Priority)

### 1.1 HPKE Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Implement full HPKE (RFC 9180) operations
  - [x] SetupBaseS/SetupBaseR for external initialization
  - [x] Proper KEM encapsulation/decapsulation
  - [x] Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
  - [x] Context binding and export functions
  - [x] Proper nonce generation and management
- [x] Create HPKE test vectors validation
- [x] Integration with existing crypto.ts

**Status**: Full HPKE implementation completed with all tests passing (9/9 tests). This
unblocks:

- Message encryption/decryption ‚úÖ
- Welcome message generation
- External commits support
- Authenticated encryption for all MLS operations

### 1.2 Client Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] `src/client.ts` implemented.
- [x] KeyPackage generation and management.
- [x] Identity and credential management.
- [x] In-memory storage and environment detection.
- [x] Fixed credential type structure issues

**Status**: Core client operations and KeyPackage lifecycle management are fully functional (4/4 tests passing).

### 1.3 Message Framing & Processing ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Created `src/message.ts` implementing full message layer
- [x] MessageProcessor class for PublicMessage/PrivateMessage handling
- [x] HPKE-based encryption/decryption for PrivateMessage content
- [x] Message authentication and signature verification for PublicMessage
- [x] Replay protection with nonce tracking and generation counter
- [x] Utility functions for message validation, parsing, and serialization
- [x] Support for both application and protocol messages
- [x] Proper epoch and group ID validation

**Status**: Message layer completed and ready for integration testing. This was the critical missing piece for secure message processing.

### 1.4 Group Implementation (`src/group.ts`) üöß IN PROGRESS

- [x] Basic class structure (`MLSGroup`) and core properties.
- [x] Initial group creation (`MLSGroup.create`).
- [x] Proposal generation for Add, Remove, Update.
- [x] Fixed critical RatchetTree recursion bug (was blocking all operations)
- [x] Basic commit method with provisional tree logic and UpdatePath generation.
- [x] Core tree operations now functional (addLeaf, treeHash, etc.)
- [x] Full state machine validation implemented in processCommit
- [x] Fixed API mismatches in group operations
  - [x] Update credential field access patterns
  - [x] Fix proposal structure field mappings
  - [x] Fix enum reference patterns
- [x] Improved KeyPackage validation logic
- [ ] **TODO**: Complete `joinFromWelcome` implementation 
- [ ] **TODO**: Integrate message layer with group encrypt/decrypt operations

**Status**: Group operations are now significantly improved with proper state machine validation. Core functionality is working but needs complete integration testing. PSK support and external commits now implemented.

## Phase 2: Advanced Features

### 2.1 External Commits ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] GroupInfo generation and signing
- [x] External commit processing
- [x] Ratchet tree extension for external joins

### 2.2 Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] PSK proposal generation and processing
- [x] deriveSecret helper for PSK integration
- [x] Integration with key schedule
- [x] Support for external and resumption PSKs

### 2.3 Resumption Operations ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Group resumption with subset of members
- [x] PSK injection into resumed groups
- [x] Proper member transfer between groups

## Phase 3: Production Readiness

### 3.1 Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Lazy loading of tree nodes
- [ ] Efficient tree diff algorithms
- [ ] Batch proposal processing
- [ ] Key material caching strategies

### 3.2 Reliability Features
- [ ] Automatic key package refresh
- [ ] Heartbeat/keepalive Update proposals
- [ ] Recovery from missed messages
- [ ] State synchronization protocols

### 3.3 Security Hardening
- [ ] Constant-time operations where needed
- [ ] Key material zeroing
- [ ] Side-channel resistance
- [ ] Formal security audit preparation

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration

### 4.1 Transport Layer
- [ ] WebSocket transport adapter
- [ ] Message queuing integration
- [ ] Delivery receipt handling

### 4.2 Application Layer
- [ ] React/Vue components
- [ ] Message history management
- [ ] Rich media support
- [ ] Typing indicators

### 4.3 Deployment Tools
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Kubernetes operators
- [ ] Monitoring/metrics
- [ ] Key rotation automation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [x] HPKE operations with test vectors
- [x] Client operations
- [ ] Crypto operations (Signatures, KDF, AEAD) with test vectors
- [x] Tree operations edge cases
- [ ] Key schedule derivations
- [x] Message encoding/decoding
- [x] Group operations (add, remove, update, commit)
- [x] External commits and PSK operations
- [x] Group resumption functionality

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Multi-client scenarios (e.g., Alice creates group, Bob joins, messages exchanged)
- [ ] Concurrent operations
- [ ] Network failure handling
- [ ] State recovery

### Conformance Tests
- [ ] RFC 9420 test vectors (for applicable sections)
- [ ] Interoperability testing
- [ ] Cross-implementation validation
