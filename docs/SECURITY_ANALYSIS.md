## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Production Hardening

### 1. Security Audit Recommended üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Status**: Core implementation complete and architecturally sound
**Recommendation**: Professional security audit before high-security production deployment
**Current Mitigation**: 
- All cryptographic operations use well-audited @noble libraries
- Complete RFC 9420 compliance with comprehensive testing
- No known critical vulnerabilities in protocol implementation

### 2. Storage Security Enhancement üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY  
**Issue**: Keys stored in plaintext in storage backends
**Security Impact**: Local attacker with storage access could extract keys
**Current Mitigation**:

**Future Enhancement**: Storage-level encryption with user-derived keys

### 3. Advanced Cryptographic Algorithms üü¢ LOW PRIORITY
**Status**: Missing X448/Ed448 support (not available in @noble libraries)
**Current**: Using X25519/Ed25519, P-256/384/521 as robust alternatives
**Security Impact**: Minimal - current algorithms are cryptographically strong
**Assessment**: Not a security concern for typical deployments
