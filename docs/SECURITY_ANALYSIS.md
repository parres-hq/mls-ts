# MLS Implementation Security Analysis (Updated May 2025)

## Security Status: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS - Still NOT Production Ready

This document outlines the current security posture of the MLS TypeScript/Deno implementation. While foundational cryptographic elements like HPKE are complete, critical protocol-level components are still missing or incomplete, making this implementation unsuitable for production use.

### Recent Progress & Current Strengths

✅ **HPKE (RFC 9180) FULLY IMPLEMENTED** (`src/hpke.ts`)
-   Complete RFC 9180 HPKE functionality, including all modes (Base, PSK, Auth, AuthPSK).
-   Provides robust authenticated encryption (AES-GCM, ChaCha20Poly1305) with AEAD.
-   Secure KEM for all specified curves (X25519, P-256, P-384, P-521).
-   Context export for secure key derivation.
-   Proper nonce management and sequence number handling.
-   This resolves a major previous blocker and provides the necessary cryptographic primitives for message and group secret protection.

✅ **Client Implementation Foundation** (`src/client.ts`)
-   Provides mechanisms for KeyPackage generation and identity management.

✅ **Core Cryptographic Primitives Solid** (`src/crypto.ts`, `@noble` libraries)
-   Utilizes well-audited @noble libraries for hashing, signatures, and AEAD ciphers.
-   Proper implementation of `DeriveSecret` and `ExpandWithLabel`.

✅ **Well-Defined Structures and Encoding** (`src/types.ts`, `src/encoding.ts`)
-   Follows RFC 9420 for data structures and TLS-style encoding.

✅ **Ratchet Tree and Key Schedule Logic** (`src/ratchet-tree.ts`, `src/key-schedule.ts`)
-   Core logic for tree management and epoch secret derivation is in place, forming the backbone of MLS group state.

### Critical Missing Components & Remaining Security Issues:

1.  ❌ **Message Layer (`src/message.ts`) - NOT IMPLEMENTED**
    *   **Security Impact**: **No actual message protection.** Application messages cannot be securely framed, encrypted, or authenticated according to MLS protocol rules.
    *   **Details**: Missing `PublicMessage` and `PrivateMessage` structures, no integration of HPKE for content encryption, no sender authentication for `PublicMessage`, no AAD construction specific to MLS messages, no replay protection.
    *   **Status**: **HIGHEST PRIORITY TO IMPLEMENT.**

2.  ❌ **Group Operations (`src/group.ts`) - INCOMPLETE & UNVALIDATED**
    *   **Security Impact**: **Group state can be corrupted, invalid operations may pass, members may not join/be removed securely.**
    *   **Details**:
        *   Proposal/Commit handling is rudimentary.
        *   `joinFromWelcome` is a stub and cannot securely process Welcome messages.
        *   `processCommit` does not fully validate incoming commits or apply changes securely.
        *   State transitions are not rigorously enforced by a protocol state machine.
        *   Welcome message generation is not yet implemented (though HPKE unblocks it).
        *   Interaction with the (missing) `src/message.ts` for framing Commits is absent.
    *   **Status**: **HIGH PRIORITY FOR COMPLETION AND VALIDATION after `src/message.ts`.**

3.  ❌ **Protocol State Machine & Comprehensive Validation - LARGELY ABSENT**
    *   **Security Impact**: **Vulnerable to protocol-level attacks due to lack of strict state transition validation.**
    *   **Details**: No overarching mechanism to ensure incoming proposals/commits are valid in the current group context and epoch. This affects all group operations.
    *   **Status**: Needs to be designed and integrated with `src/group.ts`.

4.  ⚠️ **No Credential Verification (Beyond Basic Structure)**
    *   **Security Impact**: Potential for impersonation if credential validation (e.g., expiry, chain of trust for more complex types) is not performed.
    *   **Details**: `BasicCredential` is used, but no external validation logic is in place.
    *   **Status**: Lower priority than message/group ops, but essential for production.

5.  ⚠️ **No Encryption at Rest for Stored Keys/State**
    *   **Security Impact**: Sensitive key material and group state stored via `MLSStorage` (IndexedDB or in-memory) are in plaintext.
    *   **Details**: If the storage medium is compromised, keys can be extracted.
    *   **Status**: Lower priority, but important for protecting long-term keys.

6.  ⚠️ **Replay Protection - PARTIAL HOOKS, NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
    *   **Security Impact**: Potential for replay attacks if not correctly and comprehensively implemented.
    *   **Details**: Key schedule generates nonces, HPKE handles sequence numbers, but MLS-level generation tracking in messages and validation are missing (part of `src/message.ts` and group processing).
    *   **Status**: Tied to `src/message.ts` and `src/group.ts` implementation.

### Security Recommendations & Path Forward:

1.  **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**: The implementation is currently for research, development, and educational purposes only.
2.  **Immediate Priority**:
    *   **Implement `src/message.ts`**: This is the most critical missing piece for enabling basic secure communication. Focus on `PrivateMessage` encryption using HPKE, `PublicMessage` signing, and correct AAD usage.
3.  **Next Priority**:
    *   **Complete and Validate `src/group.ts`**: 
        *   Implement `joinFromWelcome` and `processCommit` robustly.
        *   Integrate `src/message.ts` for framing Commits.
        *   Implement Welcome message generation.
        *   Begin implementing a strict protocol state machine to validate all operations and state transitions.
4.  **Subsequent Steps**:
    *   Implement full credential validation mechanisms.
    *   Address encryption at rest for storage.
    *   Conduct thorough testing, including negative test cases and fuzzing.
    *   Prepare for and undergo a professional security audit before any consideration for production use.

### What's Good (From a Security Foundation Perspective):

*   **Strong Cryptographic Primitives**: Reliance on @noble libraries and a complete RFC 9180 HPKE implementation is a solid base.
*   **Type Safety**: TypeScript helps prevent many common bugs.
*   **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns *should* aid in focused auditing and development of secure components.
*   **Adherence to RFCs in Core Areas**: Types, encoding, and HPKE follow specifications closely.

### Conclusion:

Significant progress has been made, especially with the completion of HPKE and the client key management basics. However, the core MLS protocol logic for message protection and secure group operations is still largely missing or incomplete. The current focus must be on building out `src/message.ts` and then completing and rigorously validating `src/group.ts` with a proper state machine. Until these are addressed, the system remains vulnerable and unsuitable for any sensitive applications.
