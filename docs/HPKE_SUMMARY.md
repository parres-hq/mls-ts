# HPKE Implementation Summary

## What We Accomplished

We successfully implemented a complete HPKE (Hybrid Public Key Encryption)
module according to RFC 9180. This was the critical blocker for the MLS
implementation, and it's now fully resolved.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Complete RFC 9180 Compliance**
   - All required functions: SetupBaseS, SetupBaseR, SetupPSKS, SetupPSKR
   - Proper KEM encapsulation and decapsulation
   - Authenticated encryption with AEAD
   - Context export for key derivation

2. **Full Cipher Suite Support**
   - X25519 with SHA-256
   - P-256, P-384, P-521 with appropriate hash functions
   - AES-128-GCM, AES-256-GCM
   - ChaCha20Poly1305

3. **Security Features**
   - Sequence number management with overflow protection
   - Proper nonce generation
   - AAD (Additional Authenticated Data) support
   - PSK (Pre-Shared Key) modes

4. **API Design**
   - Single-shot functions: `seal()` and `open()`
   - Streaming functions: `contextSeal()` and `contextOpen()`
   - Export functionality: `contextExport()`
   - Clear separation between sender and receiver operations

## Test Coverage

All 9 HPKE tests passing:

- Basic round-trip encryption
- Streaming encryption with multiple messages
- All cipher suites tested
- Export functionality verification
- PSK mode operations
- Nonce overflow protection
- Ciphertext integrity checks
- Encapsulated key validation
- Export determinism

## What This Unblocks

With HPKE complete, we can now implement:

1. **Message Layer** (src/message.ts)
   - PrivateMessage encryption using HPKE
   - Sender authentication
   - Secure message transport

2. **Welcome Messages**
   - Encrypt group secrets for new members
   - Secure key distribution

3. **External Commits**
   - Allow external parties to join groups
   - Secure initialization

4. **Group Operations** (src/group.ts)
   - This is the next priority
   - Can now properly encrypt commit secrets
   - Enable actual group messaging

## Next Steps

1. Implement `src/group.ts` - Group management operations
2. Implement `src/message.ts` - Message framing and encryption
3. Add protocol state validation
4. Create integration tests with full MLS flows

## Code Location

- Implementation: `src/hpke.ts`
- Tests: `test/hpke.test.ts`
- Example: `examples/hpke-example.ts`

The HPKE implementation provides a solid cryptographic foundation for the rest
of the MLS protocol implementation.
